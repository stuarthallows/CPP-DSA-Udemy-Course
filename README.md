## Section 3: Big 0

Omega (Ω) - Lower Bound
- Describes the best-case scenario for an algorithm.
Theta (Θ) - Tight Bound 
- Tells you what to generally expect in terms of time complexity. 
Omicron - Big O (O) - Upper Bound (Worst Case)
- It tells you the slowest an algorithm can run in the worst circumstances.

O(n^2) - Loop within a loop
O(n) - Proportional
O(log n) - Divide and conquer
O(1) - Constant
